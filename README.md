# Credits

Forked from https://github.com/szatmary/sonos.

# Changes

There are few changes have been made mostly around the structure of the generated code and how it is consumed.
There are also improvements to the event lifecycle (subscribe/renew/unsubscribe) with some other miscellaneous changes.

# Services

The service implimentations are automatically generated from the service definition XML files obtained from the Sonos devices via `makeservice.go.`

`cmd/makeservices/downloadallservices.sh` fetches them from the device and `cmd/makeservices/makeallservices.sh` generates the code.
